[![Android Arsenal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-GridListViewAdapters-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://android-arsenal.com/details/1/1035)

This libarary enables you to implement GridView like card layout within ListView with added capabilites like Paginations, Addition of Header-Footer Views, also simplifies implemention for both List & Cursor data.

This library is designed on [ViewHolder] (http://developer.android.com/training/improving-layouts/smooth-scrolling.html#ViewHolder) design pattern, it provides an easier way of linking linear data to grid alligned Views. The GridListViewAdapters will do most of tedious work for you & all you have to do is create your small modular classes & link them together.

**Looking for ListView with multiple row-types support, check [EasyListViewAdapters](https://github.com/birajpatel/EasyListViewAdapters).**

Features
========

* Enables user to add **Headers & Footers** with your Grid, as its a ListView afterall.
* Supports **flexible number of cards** in both screen orientation.
* Provides readymade PositionCalculator class which enables user to **maintain correct position after orientation** change(In case number of cards in both orienations are different).
* Library takes care of recycling all views, that **ensures performance** & helps your list view scroll smoothly.
* **Auto converts** user's linear data to grid-struture & renders it.
* **No data browsing**, Library takes care of browsing data through Grid-structure when View is being drawn or event occurs so that Users does not have to look for their data to take actions.
* Card views can be created by using **XML or Java** (doesn't restrict to XML-Only Approach).
* Load More callbacks can be registered to implement **paginatation support** to your list.
* **Handles empty cards** as well during pagination & auto replaces empty cards when more data is added.
* **Handling children viewclicks**, you can also register for Children(present inside your Cards) view click events. All these Views are registered with single OnClickListner so that this mechanism is very **memory efficient** when click event occurs users you gets clickedChildView, cardData,int eventId as callback params.
